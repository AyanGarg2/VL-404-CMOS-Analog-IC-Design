This repository contains lab reports for the course VL-404: CMOS Analog IC Design.
Each lab is archived in a structured and reproducible format, including the final report, LaTeX source, and all figures used.

Every ZIP file contains the final compiled PDF report, the complete LaTeX source file used to generate the report, and a folder named “Images Used” that includes all schematics, plots, and figures referenced in the report.

Tools Used
Cadence Virtuoso and SCL 180nm PDK. 


Lab-wise Description
Lab-1 Contains:
DC characteristic analysis of NMOS and PMOS transistors, including ID–VGS and ID–VDS plots, extraction of threshold voltage (Vth), saturation voltage (VDSAT), and study of body effect using circuit simulations.

Lab-2 Contains:
Design and analysis of MOS current mirror circuits, studying current matching accuracy, output resistance, compliance voltage, and the impact of channel-length modulation using DC and AC simulations.

Lab-3 Contains:
Design and comparative analysis of advanced current mirror topologies including cascode, Wilson, low-voltage cascode, and regulated cascode mirrors, with emphasis on output resistance, voltage headroom, and frequency response.

Lab-4 Contains:
Design and analysis of various common-source amplifier configurations such as resistor-loaded CS, active-load CS, source follower, cascode amplifier, and differential amplifier using DC, AC, transient, and process-corner simulations.

Lab-5 Contains:
Design and simulation of fully differential CMOS amplifiers, analyzing gain, unity-gain bandwidth, phase margin, and power dissipation, and studying trade-offs between NMOS- and PMOS-based current configurations.
